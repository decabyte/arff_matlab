ARFF reader/writer for MATLAB
=============================

__ARFF reader/writer for MATLAB__ is a small library that support 
Weka's ARFF files without using any native Java binding.

I needed to exchange MATLABâ€™s simulation data to and from Weka, 
the well-known data mining and machine learning software. 
I was looking for a lightweight solution that could avoid 
the use of plain formats (like TSV or CSV). This small library 
does the hard work of parsing the ARFF file format without using 
any external binding.

Keep in mind that some features are missing but feel free to add them

## Usage

Look inside [examples](examples) dir for a typical usage scenario or read
the documentation of the reader function `help arff_read` and 
the writer function `help arff_write`. Inside [extras](extras) dir one can find additional scripts (thank to the other contributors) which extend the basic features of the import/export functions. Feel free to adapt them to your personal workflow.
